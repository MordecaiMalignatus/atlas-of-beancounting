* Path of Beancounting

Ever been curious about what the numbers we all like so much actually look like
behind your mapping? Cool, me too.

* Things to be done
** TODO Data storage subsystem
*** TODO Pull in SQLite for data storage (Rusqlite?)
https://github.com/jgallagher/rusqlite

Yup, Rusqlite.
*** DONE Find way to bundle Sqlite
CLOSED: [2018-11-15 Thu 05:24]
Rusqlite has a ~bundled~ feature flag that directly embeds a binary of SQLite
for situations like windows. _fuck yessss_
*** TODO Design data scheme for storage.
** TODO Mastermind
The mastermind is the centre of the calculations. It consumes event logs, drops,
writes to the database and sends events to the frontend.

It maintains a state machine that makes it possible to sort events to maps, so
deaths can be mitigated. (A map entry to the same map after a death is taken to
be the same map, unless a new one is explicitly triggered)
** TODO Pricing
*** TODO Find way to grab and cache the poe.ninja prices
**** DONE Document the inofficial API via browser dev tools in POE.ninja.

Those are the only endpoints I've really found, and nothing else seems to really
work for that.
**** TODO Persist the cache to disk to avoid re-querying on boot.
**** TODO Provide hook to invalidate the cache.
This would probably just be a blanket refresh. Also something to be considered
for the future, not necessarily alpha.
**** TODO Implement cache seeding/restoring
When the pricing subsystem is started, refresh/restore the cache to make sure we
can rely on "Present but expired" being an accurate measure for "Item has a
price in poe.ninja"
**** TODO Provide selective cache refresh.
I want to avoid blasting out 20 http requests whenever some cache misses, so I
have to cache the category the item was found in in my cache, so I can re-query
just that.
** TODO Front-end
*** TODO Build compile script
This would need to inline everything into the ~index.html~ file, and build that
before cargo builds the main thing, to then get inlined.

Boscop, the author of web-view, posted this:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-assets
which looks like what I want to inline everything. Just need to write a build
pipe.
*** TODO Look/Wait for release of web-view
A lot of stuff changed in a few PRs that got recently merged, and I want to wait
for a release, it would make the two-way communication so much easier.
*** TODO Add "Send event to frontend" and "parse event from frontend"
Or, in other words, implement the actual two-way pipe we need.

This is somewhat blocked by Webview not having released changes past 0.2.1,
which would be very nice to have first.
*** TODO Make sure the frontend integrates well into the desktop world.
- C-w should close the window but leave the daemon running (systray)
- C-q should quit everything,
- C-, should open options,
*** TODO Provide a way to render drops immediately, filling out the pricing information later.
This would basically necessitate a "Price Update" event that would fill out
pricing to an ~Item~ already rendered in the event pipe.

Immediate rendering, even when the price-cache misses, is important for
responsiveness.
** TODO Log Parser
*** TODO Make copy of my event log on desktop and use it for testing.
*** TODO Expand Message Enum with events found in the logs.
** TODO User Input
*** TODO Look into Input Bot
https://github.com/obv-mikhail/InputBot

This will probably add another thread that has to be handled to the picture, for
hotkeys and "start new map" things.
*** TODO Handle "new maps"
I need a hotkey that, when mousing over a map, copies that map to the clipboard
(thus triggering parsing) and uses that as the new current map to which drops
will be logged.
** TODO Logging and Debugging
*** TODO Take a look at ~fern~
https://docs.rs/fern/*/fern/

It looks like the main "configurable logging thing" and considering I won't have
web-request logs to look at, this might become invaluable.
* About the Project

** Why is this being written?
I don't like uploading data like that to a centralised service for no good
reason, so here's something that works entirely machine-local, doesn't snoop for
anything, and doesn't consume too many resources.
